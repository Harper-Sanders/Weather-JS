## TASK

-----Weather App------<br />
Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures, and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data.
You can use any vector icons or any images you prefer.
You can place "days" cards as horizontal or vertical list

As an extra task, here are a few ways you could expand on the app:
Add the ability to click on a day, and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes, such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
